# DESCRIPTION FORMAT OF MERGE REQUEST (FROM DEVELOP TO STAGING OR PRODUCTION)

- What is needed to upgrade the current code to a new version?
- What is the impact?
- What with current users using the site/application

This are things i always check before releasing a new agenda version. I think we should do the same for all the other projects.

1. Maybe add something like this in the pull requests
- [X] git pull origin master
- [X] artisan migrations
- [X] composer install
- [X] gulp

2. Extra scripts
- [ ] run script x from y

3. Test
- [ ] Test X because this was the biggest change
